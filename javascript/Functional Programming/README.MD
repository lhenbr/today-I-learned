# Functional Programming
Functional programming is an alternative to object oriented programming and it consists of building programs with small, reusable functions.

## Pure Functions:
When a pure function is called many times with the same input, it will always give the same output (this is also known as idempotence) and is predictable. Another characteristic of pure functions are that they do not modify external state, or change values outside of their scope.

## Closures
 functions that make use variables defined in outer functions that have previously returned.

 ## Currying
 Currying is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take some subset of the arguments. 

 ## Composition
 Very commonly, currying is used to combine two or more functions to produce a new function. We call this process of combining functions "composition."
